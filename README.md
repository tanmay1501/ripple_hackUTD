# DataEclipseAI
Unlock the Power of Your Data, From Start to Insight.
 
## Description
DataEclipseAI_** was built to solve the critical challenge of understanding and managing data flows.
In today’s data-driven world, it’s just as important to know how data moves as it is to understand 
what it means. Our solution provides organizations with complete visibility into how data is created, 
accessed, moved, and used — with clear business context. The name **_DataEclipseAI_** reflects our mission: 
to remove the "eclipse" or shadow cast on the data analytics process, offering organizations a brighter,
more transparent view of their entire data lifecycle.
 
By leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, **_DataEclipseAI_** automates data analysis, recommends
optimal cleaning methods, and suggests the best models based on performance metrics. Users can then 
customize their approach, experimenting with different models and cleaning techniques to fine-tune 
results, ensuring security, performance, and compliance at every stage of the data lifecycle.
 
# Installation

# Usage
  DataEclipseAI provides end-to-end visibility into the lifecycle of your data. 
  It allows organizations to securely upload, clean, and analyze their data with AI-powered
  insights. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the platform automates data preprocessing, 
  including missing value imputation and outlier detection. It then applies predictive models to 
  analyze and forecast outcomes, offering users the ability to visualize and customize each stage 
  of the process. The platform enhances data governance by mapping the entire data journey—from creation
  to consumption—ensuring transparency and accuracy at every step.
 
 
# Features
  **Automated Data Cleaning:** We’ve automated complex data cleaning tasks, reducing manual 
  effort and increasing data quality.
 
  **Comprehensive Model Selection:** By integrating multiple machine learning algorithms,
